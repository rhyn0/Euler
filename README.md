# Euler

## By Ryan Ozawa

[Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net) in multiple languages - Currently Python only

### Starter Code Python

If someone were interested in trying their hand at these problems in Python, I have some preformatted setup in the `Starter` folder.

### Warning from ProjectEuler

> Please do not deprive others of going through the same process by publishing your solution outside of Project Euler. Members found to be spoiling problems beyond the first one-hundred problems will have their accounts locked.

As such, will only publish test cases and code up to the first 100 problems.
